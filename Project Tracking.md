# Project Tracking

- [x] Clean Data
> - Economic Data Analysis
> - Understand the electoral result format and its relationship with state data.
> - Confirm treatment of one administration cycle (4 years) and account for economic growth across this period.
> - Create and verify a proper timeframe for analysis.
- [x] Process Data
> - Simplify Model Inputs for both of the datasets
> - Evaluate the impact of including additional political parties in the model.
> - Simplify the process by focusing only on relevant and impactful variables.
- [X] Merge Data
> - Data Preparation
>    - Address dimensional inconsistencies in datasets by reformatting tables.
>    - Isolate economic indicators into individual tables and merge them with electoral results for clarity.
> - Validate and Fix Data
> - Identify and resolve duplicate datasets.
>    - Ensure completeness for terms (e.g., economic data for 2013-2014 is accurately captured for the 2009-2013 administration).
> - Correlation Setup
>     - Correlate electoral results with the corresponding economic indicators for the previous presidential term.
>        - Example: Link 2012 electoral results to 2009-2013 economic indicators (e.g., Real GDP).
>     - Verify all necessary economic data is included before segmentation.
- [ ] Correlate Data
> - Establish relationships between economic indicators and electoral outcomes for each presidential term.
> - Use statistical methods (e.g., regression, Pearson correlation) to quantify the impact of each indicator.
> - It can just be correlation or causation.
- [X] Visualize Data
> - Create compelling visuals to represent correlations and trends (e.g., bar graphs, line charts, scatter plots).
> - Ensure visuals highlight key insights while remaining accessible to a broad audience.
> - Validate the each visualization of the data
> - Improve on Clarity of showcasing
> - Add overall United State's economic indication & electoral result.
- [ ] Present the Story
> - Polish the analysis and visuals for public display in the repository.
> - Draft a narrative that ties together your findings, explaining the significance of trends and correlations.
