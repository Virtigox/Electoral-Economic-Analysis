### **Best Indicators for Correlation with Electoral Results and Economic Growth**:

1. **Real GDP (millions of chained 2017 dollars)**:
    
    - Represents overall economic output and growth in the state.
    - Correlates strongly with economic health and can provide insights into the state's economic trajectory.
2. **Real Personal Income (millions of constant 2017 dollars)**:
    
    - Indicates the purchasing power of individuals in the state, adjusted for inflation.
    - Higher personal income often aligns with improved economic satisfaction and may influence voting behavior.
3. **Real PCE (millions of constant 2017 dollars)**:
    
    - Reflects consumer spending, which can indicate economic confidence.
    - Voters in states with higher or growing consumer spending may feel better about the economy.
4. **Total Employment (number of jobs)**:
    
    - Job creation is a direct indicator of economic performance and tends to influence voter sentiment significantly.
5. **Per Capita Personal Income**:
    
    - Highlights the average income of individuals in the state.
    - Can be used to measure economic inequality and standard of living.
6. **Per Capita Disposable Personal Income**:
    
    - Focuses on income available for spending or saving after taxes.
    - May correlate with how voters perceive their personal financial situation.


To calculate the growth of each description over a 4-year election cycle and assess whether this data is a good indicator for correlating with electoral results, follow these steps:

---

### 1. **Calculate Growth Over Each Election Cycle (4 Years)**

The formula for percentage growth between two points is:

Growth (%)=Value at End of Cycle−Value at Start of CycleValue at Start of Cycle×100\text{Growth (\%)} = \frac{\text{Value at End of Cycle} - \text{Value at Start of Cycle}}{\text{Value at Start of Cycle}} \times 100Growth (%)=Value at Start of CycleValue at End of Cycle−Value at Start of Cycle​×100

#### Example Code:

If your data spans from 1996 to 2020 (8 terms, each 4 years), calculate the growth for each description column:

python

Copy code

`# Select years relevant to election cycles election_years = [1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016, 2020]  # Filter the columns corresponding to those years election_cycle_data = state_gdp_data[election_years]  # Calculate percentage growth for each election cycle growth_data = election_cycle_data.pct_change(axis=1) * 100  # Drop rows where growth can't be computed (e.g., for the first year in each state) growth_data = growth_data.dropna(axis=1)  # Add descriptions and states back for context growth_data['GeoName'] = state_gdp_data['GeoName'] growth_data['Description'] = state_gdp_data['Description']`

---

### 2. **Why Data from 1996–2020 Is a Strong Indicator**

Using data from 1996 to 2020 (8 cycles) is a reasonable timeframe because:

- **Representative of Modern Elections**:
    - Covers different economic environments (boom, recession, recovery).
    - Includes significant shifts in voter preferences and party control (e.g., the 2008 financial crisis, 2016 populism).
- **Sufficient Data Points for Correlation**:
    - With 8 election cycles, you can analyze patterns across states and indicators to establish robust trends.
- **Economic Relevance**:
    - Reflects the effects of globalization, automation, and technology—key economic factors shaping modern voting behavior.

---

### 3. **Correlation Analysis**

Once you calculate the growth data:

1. **Align Electoral Results**:
    
    - Use election data (e.g., state-level vote shares, winning parties).
    - Ensure results align with the 4-year economic cycles.
2. **Perform Statistical Correlation**:
    
    - Test correlation between each indicator's growth and electoral results (e.g., party preference, vote share percentage).
    - Use Python’s `scipy.stats.pearsonr()` or `pandas.corr()` for linear correlations.
3. **Explore Nonlinear Trends**:
    
    - If relationships aren’t linear, explore regression models or classification approaches (e.g., logistic regression).

---

### 4. **Potential Refinements**

1. **Control for External Factors**:
    
    - Adjust for population growth (per capita metrics are useful).
    - Account for major economic events like recessions or pandemics.
2. **Regional Differences**:
    
    - Consider grouping states with similar economic profiles (e.g., manufacturing vs. tech-driven).
3. **Test Different Timeframes**:
    
    - You might also examine longer cycles (e.g., 8 years) or even yearly trends for additional granularity.



**Economic Growth
- I am thinking about calculating the growth of economy during one-term presidental adminstration. 
- I believe rather than claculating the growth of economy from 1st year to 4th year, wouldn't it be great to calculate each gaps years growth, and find the average among them.
### 1. **Time Alignment with Electoral Cycles**

- **Presidential Terms**: Align the economic data to match the four-year presidential terms. For example:
    - 1997–2000 for President A
    - 2001–2004 for President B
    - Continue similarly.
- **Averaging Growth Rates**: Instead of using raw data for each year, compute the average growth rate or the cumulative growth during each term.

### 2. **Normalize Economic Data**

Normalization ensures that data is comparable across states. Apply these techniques:

#### (a) **Min-Max Normalization**

Transforms values to a scale of 0–1:

$Xnormalized=X−min(X)max(X)−min(X)X_{\text{normalized}} = \frac{X - \text{min}(X)}{\text{max}(X) - \text{min}(X)}Xnormalized​=max(X)−min(X)X−min(X)​$

- Example: Normalize GDP growth rates for each state across all years.

#### (b) **Z-Score Normalization**

Transforms values to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1:

$Z=X−μσZ = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}Z=σX−μ​$

- Useful for identifying outliers and standardizing data.

}

  

# Create a function to map each year to the corresponding term

def map_to_term(year):

data_melted = data.melt(id_vars=['State', 'Indicator'], var_name='Year', value_name='Value')

  

# Convert 'Year' to numeric

data_melted['Year'] = pd.to_numeric(data_melted['Year'], errors='coerce')

  

# Map each year to the corresponding term

data_melted['Term'] = data_melted['Year'].apply(map_to_term)

  

# Drop rows with no term mapping

data_melted = data_melted.dropna(subset=['Term'])

  

# Print the first few rows to verify the changes

print(data_melted.head())

  

# Save the aligned data without normalization

output_path = "/workspaces/My_Vault/electoral_analysis/Aligned_Economic_Data.csv"

data_melted.to_csv(output_path, index=False)

  

print(f"Aligned data saved to {output_path}")
