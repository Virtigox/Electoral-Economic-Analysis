- [x] Clean Data
>- After processing Economic Data, electoral result in each states would be determined.
>- Read the electoral result data, try to understand the format, and data points of under each row.
>- I have to make sure how to treat 1 cycle of administration, and the economic growth between that.
>- Make a proper time frame and calculate again for proper duration or 4 year administration.
- [x] Process Data
>- Think about whether adding other parties is appropriate for the model or not
>- Make it more simple 
- [ ] Merge Data
>- Two datasets don't have same dimension of the table; therefore, there should be more formatting before merge them into proper table.
>- The best way is to separate each economic indicator to individual tables, and merge them with electoral result. Therefore, there will be different tables specializing in different economic growth indicator.
>- Fix the duplicated datasets, and validate the merged_data 
>- Then I can clearly see the trend of each economic indicator reflecting on electoral result.
>- After solving that, For example, the result of economic indicator from term 2009-2013 will be resulted or correlate the electoral result in 2012.
>- Before solving this correlation problem, check economic data, whether I include the complete data of 2013(which the economic result of 2013 to 2014).
>- Then I am good to segment each term of electoral result with each term of presidental cycle for specific economic indicator
>   - Example: 2012 electoral result is correlated from 2009-2013 economic indicator of realGDP.
