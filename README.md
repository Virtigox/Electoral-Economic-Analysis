# Project Objective

The goal of this project is to investigate the relationship between a state's economic growth and its voting behavior during presidential elections. Specifically:

1.  Identify key economic indicators (e.g., GDP, employment) that might influence voting outcomes.
2. Explore correlations between economic trends during an administration's term and electoral results in the subsequent election.
3. Analyze and visualize patterns at both the state and national levels to highlight how economic factors shape political preferences.

# Data Visualization of Economic Growth & Election Outcomes in the U.S.
> This project presents a data visualization of all 50 U.S. states, including Washington, D.C., focusing on economic growth trends and electoral outcomes.

**Left Graph: Economic Growth Trends**
> The left graph illustrates economic growth over different presidential terms, highlighting key economic indicators:

1. Real GDP
2. Real Per Capita Personal Income
3. Real Personal Income
4. Real Per Capita PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditures)
5. Real PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditures)
6. Total Employment

**What Does "Real" Mean?**
> "Real" means the values are adjusted for inflation, so they show actual economic growth instead of just rising prices.

> Each data point is associated with the corresponding U.S. president during the given period.

**Right Graph: Electoral Outcomes**
> The right graph visualizes election results, showing the winning and losing rates of candidates from the two major political parties:
1. Democratic Party
2. Republican Party
> This visualization provides insights into the relationship between economic performance and electoral trends in different states.
